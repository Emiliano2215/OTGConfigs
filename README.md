OTGConfigs
==========
OpenTerrainGenerator (for Minecraft 1.12.2) configurations.

The Nether configuration is derived (with permission) from that created by

Chest Loot Tables
-----------------
Custom structures derived from vanilla Minecraft designs use the vanilla
Minecraft loot table for their chests.

To generate chest loot, you must provide a datapack that supplies those loot
tables. You may find the following links helpful:

The chest loot table IDs used in all custom structures are tabulated below.

| World   | Structure              | Loot table                                  |
| :---    | :---                   | :---                                        |
| The End | `EndEggEndermite`      | `otgconfigs:chests/end_egg_endermite`       |
| The End | `EndEggEnderman`       | `otgconfigs:chests/end_egg_enderman`        |
| The End | `EndSpikeSilverfish`   | `otgconfigs:chests/end_spike_silverfish`    |
| The End | `EndTempleCoral`       | `otgconfigs:chests/end_temple_coral`        |
| The End | `EndTempleSmall`       | `otgconfigs:chests/end_temple_small`        |
| The End | `EndTempleSmallFrosty` | `otgconfigs:chests/end_temple_small_frosty` |
| The End | `EndVillagerPod`       | `otgconfigs:chests/end_villager_pod`        |

The `EndVillagerPod` structure has two chests, but only one of them has loot.
